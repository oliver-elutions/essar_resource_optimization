"""
This module is to give some utility functions to help with converting data that was downloaded historically to the live deployment format. This process consists of the
following steps:

This procedure assumes the starting data is the historical data where the columns are the object/datapoint names for each tag (index is the date) that match the mapper file
1. Get the object/datapoint ids from the object/datapoint names (the columns)
2. Identify the needed property names/ids from for live deployment (this must be done manually ...)
3. Use the MapperHandler to create mapping from names to ids
    3.1: create an instance of a MapperHandler (mh)
    3.2.a: Subset the mapper using mh.filter_mapper using the mapper, object_ids, and property_ids
    3.3.a: Create the mappings (name_to_id and id_to_name) based on the subsetted mapper using mh.create_mappings

    3.2.b: Use mh.read_filter_create_extract to get the mappings (name_to_id, id_to_name)

4. Convert the dataframe columns to the live deployment format (column_names_to_ld_format)
5. Use put_data to write out a single row in the live deployment format to a file
6. Repeat 5 for as many as many rows as you'd like

NOTE: there is a higher level function will will run steps 3 and 4 and it is called convert_to_ld
